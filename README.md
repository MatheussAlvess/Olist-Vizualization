## Understanding Business Questions 
KC is a real estate sales company where its profit is in the arbitrage of the purchase, that is, 
in buying real estate for a value 'x' and selling it later for a higher value. However, the CEO had 
a question, given a portfolio of properties, from which they should be purchased and, once purchased, 
when should the sale be carried out in order to guarantee a profit. 

**Questions:**

The CEO of KC House held a meeting and the company's metrics were discussed. The CEO's requests are:

1 - Which property should be purchased and for what value?

2 - Once purchased, when is the best period to sell?

3 - Want to access purchase suggestions remotely.


## Solution Planning

To answer the CEO's questions, the following purchase conditions were suggested:
- Houses built before 1960 in good condition, and below average price;
- Houses overlooking the water with price below average;
- Houses that have not undergone renovation and are in good condition, and below average price;
- Houses that have a basement and price below the median.

And the following conditions of sale:
- If the sale period is bad, sale value = 'House value + 10%'
- If the sale period is good, sale value = 'House value + 30%'
     > Good period for purchase = (Spring or Summer) and 1st semester of the year

     > Bad period = otherwise

## Main Insights

#### Hypothesis creation and correlation visualization.

- H1: Houses in better condition have prices above the median
  - **TRUE - Houses classified as in good condition have a median price above the median of the portfolio**

- H2: Homes built before 1960 are 30% cheaper
  - **FALSE - Homes built before 1960 are only 4.4% cheaper**
  
- H3: Homes located overlooking the water are 50% more expensive on average
  - **FALSE - Homes with a water view are approximately 200% more expensive, on average, compared to those without a water view**
  
- H4: In the first half of the year the price of the house is 20% more expensive, on average
  - **FALSE - In the first semester, houses are only 2.3% more expensive, on average, when compared to the second semester**

- H5: Houses that have been renovated are priced higher than the median
  - **TRUE - Houses that have undergone renovation have prices higher than the median of the portfolio**

- H6: Houses that have 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms are priced above the median
  - **TRUE - Homes with more than 3 bedrooms and more than 2 bathrooms are priced around 19% higher than the portfolio median**

- H7: House prices have a 10% MoM (Month over Month) increase
  - **FALSE - MoM growth is not linear and does not reach 10% higher in any month**

- H8: Homes with a basement are 20% more expensive, on average
  - **TRUE - Homes with a basement are more expensive than the portfolio median and 25% more expensive compared to those without a basement**

- H9: Houses with a number of floors above 2 are 20% more expensive, on average
  - **FALSE - Houses with 2 floors and above tend to be more expensive, but are not 20% more expensive than average**

- H10: Homes are 20% more expensive in summer, on average
  - **FALSE - Houses are more expensive in spring and summer and cheaper in winter, but in summer they don't have this 20% impact**
